A comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This project aims to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival using Python and common data visualization tools.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of a self-guided data science learning journey to build hands-on skills in EDA. Using the Titanic dataset, we explore how different factors—such as **age**, **gender**, **ticket class**, and **port of embarkation**—affected survival chances during the tragic event.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and explore the structure and quality of the Titanic dataset
- Perform **univariate**, **bivariate**, and **multivariate** analysis
- Detect and handle **missing values** and **outliers**
- Explore the **target variable** and how it relates to other features
- Draw meaningful **insights**, **conclusions**, and **recommendations**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mariyamalshatta/masterclass-1-a-comprehensive-guide-for-eda)

## 🔍 Key Steps in EDA

1. **Project Setup** – Defined title, objectives, and tools
2. **Initial Data Exploration** – Reviewed dataset shape, types, missing values, etc.
3. **Univariate Analysis** – Analyzed distributions of individual features
4. **Bivariate Analysis** – Explored relationships between feature pairs
5. **Multivariate Analysis** – Investigated combined feature effects on survival
6. **Outlier Detection** – Identified and reasoned about outliers
7. **Target Variable Analysis** – Explored survival distribution and influencing factors
8. **Conclusions & Recommendations** – Summarized insights for future modeling

---

## 📊 Insights & Highlights

- **Women and children in higher classes** were more likely to survive
- **Males in 3rd class** had the lowest survival rates
- Outliers in `Fare` and missing values in `Age` and `Cabin` provided socioeconomic insights
- Embarkation location (`Embarked`) showed a link to survival—particularly from Cherbourg

## 📌 Final Notes

This project not only demonstrates technical EDA skills but also develops data storytelling and critical thinking essential for any data scientist. It can serve as a foundation for future predictive modeling work using this dataset.
